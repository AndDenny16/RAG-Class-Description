#  Davidson College Class Schedule Semantic Search with Pinecone, Open AI SDK

##  Overview

Class Schedules are boring, .. usually you have to filter many times (Major, Time, Teacher) to get down and see the actual Class Descriptions. This process could leave potentially hundreds of interesting classes that could fit your interests potentially unchecked

The Davidson Class Explorer will help you find your ideal class in the midst of a sea of Class Descriptions. You provide three concepts/phrase or words and Class Explorers creates your ideal class description using OpenAI's SDK. This ideal class is a complete hypothetical/fake class generated by ChatGPT. This fake class's embedding is then Cosine Similarity compared with all of embeddings of Davidson's Classes to find you, the closest class at Davidson to your ideal fake class


## Flask Python Server

**1.ingest.py** - Creating the Pinecone Vector Store 

  - **Calls the Davidson API** parses together the metadata of all Davidson Classes
  - **OpenAI Embeddings** python SDK to get the embeddings of the descriptions
  - **Pydantic** to ensure consistency of length of embeddings
  - **Upsert** all the embeddings into Pinecone Index
    
    
**2. main.py** - Main Search Functionality using Pinecone Cosine Similarity Search

**3. app.py** - Simple Flask Server to Connect to Frontend
  - Routes
      - **POST /build**  - Creates 'ideal' fake course description
         - Request Body:
           ```
           {"topics" : ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"]}
           ```
      - **POST /getclasses** - Retrieves 2 most similar Davidson Classes to the Ideal
      - Request Body
        ```
           {"description" : "Fake Ideal Class Description}
           ```

        - **GET /info** - Information on the Server
        - **GET /health** - Health Check
